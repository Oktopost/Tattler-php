# Tattler user

Any tattler user represents a predictable string, generated by unique user information.

```php
/** @var IUser $user */
$user = new User();
$user->setName('anything', 'uniq', 'with', 'any', 'other', 'args'); // will generate '921757b2-14b3-544d-b29c-9dcb9c61431f'
```

For defining current user (i.e. the one who is currently requesting channels) you must set his socket id and 
pass him to tattler instance
```php
$user->setSocketId($socketId);
$tattler->setUser($user);
```

**It is really important to define current user. As long as you want to send different messages to different users**
