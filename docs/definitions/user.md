# Tattler user

Any tattler user represents a string, generated by unique user information.

```php
/** @var IUser $user */
$user = \Tattler\SkeletonInit::skeleton(IUser::class);
$user->setName('current', 'user', 'id', 'with', 'any', 'args')
```

For defining current user (i.e. the one who is currently requesting channels) you must set his socket id and 
pass him to tattler instance
```php
$user->setSocketId($socketId);
$tattler->setUser($user);
```

**It is really important to define current user. As long as you want to send different messages to different users**
